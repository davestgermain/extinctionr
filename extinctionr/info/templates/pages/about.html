		<h1 class="text-uppercase">About Extinction Rebellion</h1>
<p>Extinction Rebellion is a strictly non-violent movement, whose overall ambition is an international rebellion that helps humanity to turn quickly onto a course that is compatible with life on earth, and to build resilient communities in the face of ecological and societal crisis. We operate under the principals of <a href="https://www.holacracy.org/">Holocracy</a> with a decentralized structure.</p>

<p>Founded by <a href="https://risingup.org.uk/">Rising Up!</a> in the UK, Extinction Rebellion took its first acts of civil disobedience  in November 2018, as 6000 rebels shut down five London bridges. Immediately after this, the movement grew rapidly to become an international uprising which now spans over 200 chapters worldwide.</p>

<p>Extinction Rebellion welcomes all people, regardless of race, gender identity, religion, political affiliation, age, ethnicity, economic background, etc. This movement is about all of us! We are you! Anyone who follows our 10 principals and values can take action in the name of Extinction Rebellion and <em>Rising Up!</em></p>

To show to radical people (and internationally) that it is possible to have an “impossible” plan and carry out a rebellion – however small (or large!) and thus increase the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">overton window</a>” of acceptable discourse on the ecological crisis. </li>

			<li class="m-3">
			<hr />
<!-- <h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-lighter">Two</h2> -->
<h2 class="pt-3" style="text-align:left">TWO.</h2>
To create a national conversation about the ecological crisis and climate breakdown – including that our families, communities, society, and state are facing existential threat. This includes to discuss our demands with the government and political parties. Also to support further uprisings to demand change off the back of the door we open.</li>

			<li class="m-3">
			<hr />
<!--<h2 class="text-uppercase font-weight-lighter">Three</h2> -->
<h2 class="pt-3" style="text-align:left">THREE.</h2>
To build structure, community, and test prototypes in preparation for the coming structural collapse of the regimes of western “democracies” - now seen as inevitable due to stored up crisis. Thus preparing a foundation to transform society and resist fascism/other extremes. This includes creating <em>Rising from the Wreckage</em> &mdash; a Citizens Assembly based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition">sortition</a>.</li>

Our overall ambition is an international rebellion that helps humanity to turn quickly onto a course that is compatible with life on earth. However we are unattached to this outcome, we also make these valiant efforts, to lead an honorable life in this time of grief, destruction and unraveling.</li>
