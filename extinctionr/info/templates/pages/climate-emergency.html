<h4>DRAFT RESOLUTION ENDORSING THE DECLARATION OF A CLIMATE & ECOLOGICAL EMERGENCY AND AN IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION TO RESTORE A SAFE CLIMATE</h4>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, on August 7, 2008, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts signed into law the Global Warming Solutions Act, making it one of the first states in the nation to move forward with a comprehensive regulatory program to address Climate Change;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, on April 22, 2016, world leaders from 175 countries recognized the threat of Climate Change and the urgent need to combat it by signing the Paris Agreement, agreeing to keep warming “well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C”;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, on August 9, 2018, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts signed into law AN ACT PROMOTING CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION, ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION, AND INVESTMENT IN RECREATIONAL ASSETS AND OPPORTUNITY, an emergency law to preserve the Commonwealth’s environment and pursue Climate Change adaptation methods;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, on October 8, 2018, the United Nations released a special report, which projected that limiting warming to the 1.5°C target this century will require an unprecedented transformation of every sector of the global economy over the next 11 years;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, on November 23, 2018 the United States Federal Government issued a climate study detailing the massive threat that Climate Change poses to the American economy and underscoring the need for immediate Climate Emergency action at all levels of government;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the death and destruction already wrought by global warming of approximately 1.1°C above late 19th century levels demonstrates that the Earth is already too hot for safety, as attested by increased and intensifying wildfires, floods, rising sea levels, diseases, droughts and extreme weather;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Climate Change and the global economy’s overshoot of ecological limits are driving the sixth mass extinction of species, which has caused a 60% decline in global wildlife populations since 1970, will devastate much of life on Earth for the next 10 million years, and the mass species extinction pose as great a risk to humanity as Climate Change, according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the United States has disproportionately contributes to the climate and extinction emergencies and has repeatedly obstructed global efforts to transition toward a green economy, and thus bears a unique responsibility to rapidly address these existential threats;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, restoring a safe and stable climate requires transformative societal and economic change on a scale not seen since World War II to reach zero greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors, to rapidly and safely drawdown or remove all the excess greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, to end the sixth mass extinction of species, and to implement measures to protect all people and species from the increasingly severe consequences of Climate Change;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the Mobilization is a sweeping overhaul of the economy that centers equity and justice in its solutions and has the following goals:</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote"><em>Dramatically expand existing renewable power sources and deploy new production capacity with the goal of meeting 100% of national power demand through renewable sources; building a national, energy-efficient, “smart” grid; upgrading every residential and industrial building for state-of-the-art energy efficiency, comfort and safety; eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing, agricultural and other industries, including by investing in local-scale agriculture in communities across the country; eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from, repairing and improving transportation and other infrastructure, and upgrading water infrastructure to ensure universal access to clean water; funding massive investment in the drawdown of greenhouse gases; making “green” technology, industry, expertise, products and services a major export of the United States, with the aim of becoming an international leader ushering in a global transition, assisting other countries to become completely greenhouse gas neutral.</em></blockquote>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, marginalized populations in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and worldwide, including people of color, immigrants, indigenous communities, low-income individuals, people with disabilities, and the unhoused are already disproportionately affected by Climate Change, and will continue to bear an excessive burden as temperatures increase, oceans rise, and natural disasters worsen;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, addressing Climate Change fairly requires a “Just Transition” that is ecologically sustainable and equitable for all people, especially those most impacted by Climate Change already and those who will be most impacted in the future,</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, core to a Just Transition is equity, self-determination, culture, tradition, deep democracy, and the belief that people around the world have a fundamental human right to clean, healthy and adequate air, water, land, food, education, healthcare, and shelter;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Just Transition strategies were first forged by a “blue-green” alliance of labor unions and environmental justice groups who saw the need to phase out the industries that were harming workers, community health, and the planet, while also providing just pathways for workers into new livelihoods;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, Just Transition initiatives shift the economy from dirty energy to energy democracy, from funding new highways to expanding public transit, from incinerators and landfills to zero waste products, from industrial food systems to food sovereignty, from car-dependent sprawl and destructive unbridled growth to smart urban development without displacement, and from destructive over-development to habitat and ecosystem restoration;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, building a society that is resilient to the current, expected, and scientifically predicted effects of Climate Change will protect health, lives, ecosystems, and economies, and such resilience efforts will have the greatest positive impact if the most dramatic potential consequences of Climate Change are taken into account;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, justice calls for climate resilience that addresses the specific experiences, vulnerabilities, and needs of marginalized communities within within Massachusetts, who must be included and supported in actively engaging in climate resilience planning, policy, and actions;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, actions to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and/or drawdown greenhouse gases may be taken in ways that also improve resilience to the effects of Climate Change, and vice versa;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, justice requires that frontline communities, who have historically borne the brunt of the extractive fossil-fuel economy, participate actively in the planning and implementation of this Mobilization at all levels of government and that they benefit first from the Just Transition to a renewable energy economy;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, fairness demands the protection and expansion of workers’ right to organize as well as a guarantee of high-paying, high-quality jobs with comprehensive benefits for all as the Mobilization to restore a safe climate is launched;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, common sense demands that this unprecedented Mobilization address the full suite of existential ecological threats facing humanity in a comprehensive, integrated and timely fashion, and apply the precautionary principle to known and unknown potential risk such as tipping points and runaway greenhouse effects;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, nearly 400 cities, districts and counties across the world collectively representing over 34 million people have recently declared or officially acknowledged the existence of a global Climate Emergency, including Hoboken, San Francisco, Berkeley, Los Angeles, Montgomery County, Oakland, Richmond, and Santa Cruz in the United States, Bristol and London in the United Kingdom and many cities in Australia, Canada, and Switzerland;</p>

<p><strong>WHEREAS</strong>, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as a progressive leader of the United States, must act as a global leader by both converting to an ecologically, socially, and economically regenerative economy at emergency speed, and by rapidly organizing a regional Just Transition and Climate Emergency Mobilization;</p>
